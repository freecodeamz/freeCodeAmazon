Hi there, 

1. How to make money at Amazon?
   Taking one seller DDN INC as example. His frontstore link: https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A12F76KQ3SMNAB&merchant=A12F76KQ3SMNAB&qid=1470867169
   Taking one listing as example: 
   1.1 B00VFICX2O link: https://www.amazon.com/Depend-Adjustable-Underwear-Maximum-Absorbency/dp/B00VFICX2O/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470867400&sr=8-1&keywords=B00VFICX2O
  
   1.2 After customer placed an order for the above listing, the seller DDN INC will place a drop ship order from listing B00FEGAG90 with link: https://www.amazon.com/Depend-Adjustable-Incontinence-Underwear-Absorbency/dp/B00FEGAG90/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470867498&sr=8-1&keywords=B00FEGAG90

   1.3 In this way, you only need to make several clicks to make at least $20 per order. 
   
   1.4 Taking DDN INC as example, this seller don't have any product in stock. All his listings are playing such tricks.
